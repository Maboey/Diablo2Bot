# Diablo2Bot
a Python based bot for diablo 2

In order for this bot to work you need the diablo2 game.
Then put the "Diablo2Bot" directory in your game folder (where the .exe to launch diablo2 is)

the bot may not stop if there's a problem and can be hard to stop since it controls your mouse and clicks everywhere. Be ready to stop it (alt+f4 your compiler)
